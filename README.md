# Statistical analysis of the impact of climate change on the development of the countries in the world

Mankind nowadays lives better than in any given period of time in the past and is developing itself by the highest rate so far. [The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) estimates that in the period from 1990 to 2015, the global literacy rate increased by 11\% (from 75\% in 1990 to 86\% in 2015), and in the same period the global extreme poverty rate decreased by 26\% (from 36\% in 1990 to 10\% in 2015). The predictions by the major world organizations say that these trends are expected to continue in the future and that the extreme poverty will be eradicated by 2030, but meanwhile warn that climate change is an acute threat to the development of the countries in the world.
    
This paper applies machine learning techniques to analyze and reveal which measures (according to the measures included in the [UNDP](http://www.undp.org/)'s [Human Development Report 2018](http://hdr.undp.org/)) are the best descriptors of the development of the countries in the world and to what extent climate change affects their development.
